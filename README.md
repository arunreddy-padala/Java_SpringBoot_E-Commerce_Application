# RetailSphere_Java_Spring

This project showcases an advanced microservices architecture utilizing a robust stack of technologies including Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and various other tools. Designed to provide a scalable, resilient, and secure system for enterprise-level applications, this architecture supports automatic service discovery, centralized configuration, distributed tracing, and muchmore.

Languages & Frameworks: Java, Maven, Spring Boot Web & Cloud, Spring Security, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres DB, Resilience4J, Apache Kafka, API Gateway, Keycloak, Netflix Eureka, Zipkin, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana

Key Features:
- Service Discovery: Implemented using Netflix Eureka, allowing microservices to automatically register and discover each other without hard-coded URLs.
- Centralized Configuration: Utilizes Spring Cloud Config for managing all microservices configurations from a central repository, enhancing consistency and ease of updates.
- Distributed Tracing: Facilitated by Zipkin, this feature provides end-to-end tracing of requests across microservices, crucial for debugging and performance tuning.
- Circuit Breaker: Implements Resilience4J for fault tolerance, preventing cascading failures by halting requests to unhealthy services, thereby ensuring system stability.
- Event-Driven Architecture: Leverages Apache Kafka to decouple microservices via asynchronous message passing, enhancing system reactivity and scalability.
- Secure Microservices: Integrates Keycloak for robust identity and access management, securing microservices with advanced authentication and authorization capabilities.
- Containerization: Employs Docker, enhanced with GCP Jib for efficient multistage builds, facilitating easy deployment and scaling within containerized environments.
- Monitoring and Visualization: Utilizes Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization, tracking vital metrics such as CPU usage, memory load, and more, presented in insightful dashboards.

Deployment and Monitoring:
- Docker Images: Microservices are containerized using Docker, with images built and managed through GCP Jib, optimizing deployment processes.
- Service Monitoring: Set up with Prometheus to collect and store metrics, and Grafana for detailed visual analysis, allowing for proactive system management.
